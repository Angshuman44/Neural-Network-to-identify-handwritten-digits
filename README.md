# Neural-Network-to-identify-handwritten-digits
In this project, I employed a neural network along with TensorFlow, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to develop a model that successfully recognized handwritten digits. Through training and evaluation, the neural network demonstrated accurate and reliable recognition capabilities.
