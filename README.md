## MNIST Handwritten Digits Classifier

This repository contains a robust LeNet-5 neural network model implemented in TensorFlow for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Achieving a validation accuracy of 99.63% on the MNIST test set, this model demonstrates exceptional accuracy in recognizing digits from 0 to 9. It's worth noting that surpassing the 99% accuracy threshold is a rare accomplishment, underscoring the efficacy of the LeNet-5 neural network structure in achieving high precision in digit recognition tasks.
